Transforming a traditional business into a SaaS involves several challenging yet essential steps. Let's break it down into 4 main parts:

1. Design the boundaries of your system: What's common, core, and generic?
2. Start to think about security: How to split your data as multi and sometimes cross-company? Have you ever thought about your authorizations model?
3. Expose the Core, but Not Too Much: How to expose to maximize the user and the developer experience?
4. Callback your partner: How to encourage your partner to be reactive? How can you be reactive firstly?

I know it's a lot of questions. Someday, I'll come back to tell you how to I resolved it, but I am conviced, maybe not in this step order, these questions are where everything starts.
